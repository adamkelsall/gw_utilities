# Version 2.2.0 - 31st January 2015

This version is an incremental update, creating additional methods, fixing unintended behaviour and improving Ruby best practice implementation.

Released in support of [GW Mirror Backup Utility](https://github.com/jesskelsall/gw_mirror-backup-utility) 2.0.0.

- Resolved class file errors from the introduction of the `gw_parse.rb` **colour** method.
- Replaced `Hash[key]` value referencing with stricter `Hash.fetch(key)` [as detailed in](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#hash-fetch) bbatsov's [ruby-style-guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide).

## Classes

### gw_progress_bar.rb

- Output of max value when `:display_value` is true is no longer a `Float`.
- `:char_left` and `:char_right` arguments can now be more than one character long.

## Modules

### gw_parse.rb

- `thousands`:
  - Rewritten to support `Float` and/or negative numbers.
- `time`:
  - New method for displaying seconds in a human-readable format.
  - Uses short-hand unit symbols e.g. `12h 5m 24s`.
  - Second argument controls the amount of remainder unit values that are visible, defaults to all.

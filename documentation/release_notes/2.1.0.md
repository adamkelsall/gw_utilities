# Version 2.1.0 - 11th November 2014

This version is an incremental update, changing the functionality of existing code as well as providing coding standards tidy-ups.

## Modules

### gw_column.rb

- column_width method now ignores colour markup from the *colour* method, allowing colours to be added before this method is used.

### gw_directory.rb

- New method: `directory_parts`. Designed to treat a file or directory path as an Array and return a Range of it, delimited by `"/"` by default.

### gw_file.rb

- file_write method's *content* argument is now a splat argument, accepting any number of arguments or an Array.
- file_read method's *opts* argument now has a default value of `{}`.

### gw_parse.rb

- New method: `title`. Capitalises a String sentence based on a list of "lesser" words, with forced capitalisation on the first and last word.
- colour method now has a default value of `nil`, `:purple` has been renamed to `:magenta`. Invalid colour Symbols now correctly error out.
- thousands method now supports Floats as expected, not placing commas after the decimal point.
